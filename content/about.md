Obsessed with open source, technology, selfhosting and self-improvement.
I strive to improve myself in technology daily, and picking things up along the way.

My hobbies involve 3d printing, drawing, trying to pick up a soldering iron and hopefully soon being able to create my own pcbs and esp32 installations!
